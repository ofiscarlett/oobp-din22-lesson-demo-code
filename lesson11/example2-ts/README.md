# Typescript demo with browser dom code

To use typescript you need to compile the code for the browser. TSC is the typescript compiler, which can be used to do this.

Notice the tsconfig.json file in the folder. It controls the compilation process and decides where is the typescript source and where the javascript output should be placed.

Run `tsc --watch` for the TSC to monitor your changes.
